# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Nemuru is a Flutter-based sleep and mood tracking app with AI-powered responses. It features daily mood check-ins, personalized AI conversations via GPT-4o, and a subscription-based model.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Flutter commands
flutter pub get          # Install dependencies
flutter analyze         # Run static analysis and linting
flutter test            # Run all tests
flutter test test/widget_test.dart  # Run specific test file
flutter build ios       # Build for iOS
flutter build apk       # Build for Android
flutter run             # Run in development mode

# Supabase local development
supabase start          # Start local Supabase instance
supabase functions serve chat-completion  # Serve edge functions locally
supabase stop           # Stop local Supabase
```

## Architecture Overview

### Layer Structure
- **Models** (`/lib/models/`): Data structures for Character, ChatLog, Message
- **Services** (`/lib/services/`): Business logic layer with singleton services
- **Screens** (`/lib/screens/`): UI presentation layer
- **Widgets** (`/lib/widgets/`): Reusable UI components

### State Management
- Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier for reactive updates
- Services injected at app root via MultiProvider
- Persistent state via SharedPreferences (local) and Supabase (remote)

### Key Services
- **GPTService**: Manages AI conversations, character selection, and OpenAI integration via Supabase Edge Functions
- **ChatLogService**: CRUD operations for chat history with Supabase persistence
- **SubscriptionService**: Handles Free/Premium tiers with usage limits (Free: 2 chats/day, Premium: 3 chats/day)
- **PreferencesService**: Local settings storage including dark mode, character selection, font size
- **NotificationService**: Daily reminder notifications at 23:00

### Navigation
- Named routes with `onGenerateRoute` for parameter passing
- Main screens: CheckInScreen, LogScreen, SettingsScreen, HelpScreen
- Modal dialogs for upgrades and errors via ErrorHandlingService

### Backend Integration
- Supabase for data persistence and edge functions
- Edge function at `/chat-completion` proxies OpenAI GPT-4o API
- Device-based identification using UUID (no user accounts)
- CORS-enabled for web compatibility

### Subscription Model
- **Free Tier**: 2 conversations/day, 4 characters, 3-day log history
- **Premium Tier**: 3 conversations/day, all characters, unlimited history
- Usage tracking resets daily at midnight

### Testing & Quality
- Standard Flutter lints via analysis_options.yaml
- Widget tests in `/test/` directory
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing
